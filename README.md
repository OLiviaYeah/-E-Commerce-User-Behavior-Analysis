## About Dataset

### About
I use the eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop dataset from Kaggle. 
You can download it from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop.

This file contains behavior data for 5 months (Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020) from a medium cosmetics online store. For this project I only use the dataset of Feb 2020.
Each row in the file represents an event. All events are related to products and users. Each event is like many-to-many relation between products and users.
